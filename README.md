There are three different colored shapes that inherit from a base “shape” class (inheritance).
When you click on each shape, it prints something different to the screen through an overriden DisplayText() function (polymorphism).
Each shape contains data, such as its name or color, which are stored as properties with getters and setters (encapsulation).
Code is organized in a way that reduces duplicate code through higher level methods (abstraction).

1. Inheritance
	- Shape -> Cube / capsule / sphere
	- All have name/color/rotationSpeed

2. Polymorphisme
	- DisplayText() is overriden for each child class

3. Encapsulation
	- Limit the speed and force

4. Abstraction
	- no code duplication
